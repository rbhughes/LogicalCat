    </p>

    <p>I founded LogicalCat in 2008 to help tackle messy geoscience data at Energy E&P Companies. Data Management is a spectrum. Some companies don't even attempt it while others spend millions on monster databases protected by byzantine IT policies. I think they're forgetting something...</p>

    <h3>Data goes in...and then what?</h3>
    <p>Geologists and engineers do upstream exploration using software. Expensive, complicated interpretation software. The data used by these applications typically comes from a few vendors and may (hopefully) be supplemented from corporate data stores. Indeed, some companies have invested in middleware and workflows to keep project data updated from the trusted sources.</p> 
    <p>But it's usually a one-way street. A huge amount of time and brain-power is expended making scientific and financial decisions using these proprietary applications, but almost nothing gets <em>back</em> to the protected datastore. All this knowledge hides from decision makers, evades backups and takes extra work cycles to export and expose.</p>
    <p>Why does this problem exist? Because <em>E&P interpretation software companies have zero interest in supporting APIs</em>. They would rather sell you services. LogicalCat will become that missing API.</p>

    <h3>Some things LogicalCat can help you with...</h3>
    <dl>
      <dt>Locate Assets</dt>
      <dd>Where are those LAS files? What are the top 10 most active GeoGraphix projects? How many duplicate SEGY files do we have? Now you can know. Instantly.</dd>

      <dt>Start and Maintain Data Management </dt>
      <dd>There is no shortage of structured data management practices and procedures for the E&P Industry. LogicalCat can help you take that first <em>vendor neutral</em> step toward getting and staying organized.</dd>

      <dt>Mergers and Acquisitions</dt>
      <dd>LogicalCat can serve as your rapid reconnaissance tool. Selling? Use it to prepare a data room for your asset sale or help you discern proprietary from vendor data. Buying? Quickly discover interpretation boundaries or which projects need upgrading.</dd>

      <dt>IT Operations</dt>
      <dd>Non-geoscientists can objectively gauge which projects are the most active and plan backups and disaster recovery accordingly. Old projects can be safely archived while still retaining full metadata of their contents. Disk usage can be allocated fairly among business units.</dd>

    <h3>Try out the Free Demo</h3>

    <p>The demo includes only the "Business Documents" crawler. There's nothing particularly E&P-centric about it, but it should give you a pretty good idea of how LogicalCat works. This crawler is basically a web-app GUI for the fantastic Apache <a href="http://tika.apache.org">Tika</a> project's content analysis toolkit. Enjoy!</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Windows 7 or 8, 64-bit (32-bit is an option too)</li>
